Some issues with our email security apparatus were exposed during rollout, causing email to be suspended needlessly. We're investigating the best way to improve this before rolling this change out again.</div>\n<p>Today we announce two small changes to our email processing which will improve our Email channel's security. Zendesk Support currently has checks in place to stop spam, and block malware and other delinquent emails. This change handles some cases which should reduce the likelihood of spam or malicious emails from making their way into your tickets.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Suspending messages with uncertain authentication</strong></p>\n<p>Zendesk will now automatically suspend any email which fails a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail\">DKIM check</a>. These messages are frequently suspended now because of our spam checking tools, but this change will make that automatic. We won't automatically suspend if the header is missing, only if it actually fails a check. This standard is widely supported, failures are rare, but they're a great indication of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing\">spoofing</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing\">phishing</a> attempts. The suspension type for this will be spam.</p>\n<p>If you haven't already, you can keep up to date with your suspended tickets by <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663246-Managing-suspended-tickets-and-spam#topic_ijw_qqk_ae\">subscribing</a> to a suspended tickets notification.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Blocking spoofed Zendesk messages</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to the above, we'll be using\u00a0an extra sense\u00a0of caution when we see email which appears to be from Zendesk. Because we have already set up a <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/219401127-Zendesk-and-DMARC\">DMARC reject policy</a>, we will now be blocking any email which claims a sending address in the Zendesk domain. If it fails a DKIM check, we will reject it. Malicious actors could always pose as Zendesk to attempt to get sensitive information, so we've elected to block them completely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As we continue to grow we will continue to make changes to protect your email channel. This is not the last stop on this destination.</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong><em>Update: This feature has been rolled out to all Zendesk Support accounts.</em></strong></p>\n<p><em><em class=\"gmail_msg\">This change is being made to address a rare security concern.</em>\u00a0It was possible, through the use of subject matching, to expose a ticket's content to a user who should not be authorized to see it. We did not mention this ahead of time out of concern it would be exploited, but we are explaining it now for transparency's sake.</em></p>\n<p><em><em class=\"gmail_msg\">Because subject matching only<span class=\"m_3491115255108616381inbox-inbox-Apple-converted-space gmail_msg\">\u00a0</span>happened\u00a0when the sender of an email was also the requester of an existing ticket with the same subject, this was<span class=\"m_3491115255108616381inbox-inbox-Apple-converted-space gmail_msg\">\u00a0</span>very rare.</em> However, Zendesk Support adds CCs to a ticket when they're included in an email, making it possible to merge unrelated email threads. If one of your customers or partners sends you an email and CCs another party, a ticket is created. They might later send a new email, CC different party, and use the same subject. We\u00a0would have then updated the same ticket, and notified the first CC of the new message, which they were never meant to see.</em></p>\n<p><em>With this update, we have eliminated this possibility.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>It should come as no surprise that Zendesk processes a lot of email. We receive millions of messages a day and make a number of decisions about each; whether to reject, suspend, create a new ticket, or associate a message with an existing ticket. The last decision has a lot of moving parts.</p>\n<p>We primarily rely on message IDs (which should always be unique), our own \"encoded IDs\" (which we know are unique), and in certain circumstances the regular numerical IDs of tickets. We've also, for some time now, occasionally matched an incoming email with an existing ticket because of a matching subject line.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>Beginning November 21st, 2016</em></strong>, Zendesk will no longer match incoming email with existing tickets by means of subject.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Why this change?</span></p>\n<p>As we've grown, we've seen more false positive matches. Mailing lists and automated emails re-use subject lines. While, contact between the inboxes people use is safe, the amount of automated email in the world has made this feature more trouble than it's worth. We'll continue to rely on reliable, unique identifiers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Subject matching in Zendesk is already very uncommon. We've made it our lowest priority matching criteria, and have limited it so that it only associates two tickets when there is an exact match, and when the person sending the email is the same as the requester of the existing ticket. For this reason, there are\u00a0a very low number of subject matches each day in each account.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">What will the effects be?</span></p>\n<p>You will\u00a0see\u00a0some messages\u00a0create a new ticket when they\u00a0would have previously created a comment on an existing ticket. In most cases the messages were not directly related in the first place. In some rare occasions we receive a malformed email that lacks identifiers. This may cause\u00a0a message not to be threaded. After extensive research, we are confident this will be uncommon. The reduction in false positives and unintended associations (which have caused many concerns from Zendesk users) far outweighs this, in our opinion.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">What if we don't want this change?</span></p>\n<p>If for any reason this change seems wrong to you, or if you are currently relying on Subject Matching for any reason, let us know by adding\u00a0a comment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",
