If you are using\u00a0the latest version of the Support SDK you'll now start seeing these\u00a0actions when they happen in your mobile app.</p>\n<p>This is a fantastic way to avoid\u00a0repeating information to your customers multiple times, making it easier for your support team to give better answers the first time.</p>\n<p>You can tell when an article or search happened in your app as it will be marked as\u00a0<em>via Support SDK</em>. Take a look:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115017024708/Pathfinder.png\" alt=\"Pathfinder.png\"></p>\n<p><span id=\"unseen\" class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-x-large\">An API to check for unseen messages</span></p>\n<p>If you use Support with push notifications, your customers get a nudge to read and reply to a ticket when your agent replies. If your user\u00a0hasn't enabled push notifications\u00a0you may\u00a0want a way to\u00a0flag to them if they've\u00a0received a reply to a ticket.</p>\n<p>In this update, you now have access to an\u00a0API provider to check for unseen messages. Querying this provider will tell you whether your user's open requests have updates, and how many. You can use this information to show a flag or badge in your app.</p>\n<p><span id=\"vote\" class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-x-large\">Up/down voting on articles</span></p>\n<p>Your users can now tell you whether the articles they read were useful or not, by up or down voting on them.\u00a0You can view this information in <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203662296-Using-the-Reporting-Overview\">the reporting section</a> of your Support instance.</p>\n<p>This is done using the simple interface below, which is customisable based on your app's theme. You can also turn this off if you don't want your users to vote on articles.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115017025888/voting.png\" alt=\"voting.png\" width=\"255\" height=\"126\"></p>\n<p><span id=\"contact\" class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-x-large\">Additional 'contact us' button configuration</span></p>\n<p>In this version of the Support SDK you can decide to show a 'contact us' button on articles and the article list, only on the article list, or not at all. This gives you more flexibility\u00a0for different configurations, and particularly if you're showing articles in a standalone way.</p>\n<p><span id=\"externalid\" class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-x-large\">Removal of external ID option for anonymous users</span></p>\n<p>It is no longer possible to\u00a0set an external ID for a user when you're using anonymous identification. If you are using this feature, we recommend that you update your app to use <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/embeddables/docs/android/set_an_identity#authenticate-using-your-jwt-endpoint\">JWT authentication instead</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are using external ID and upgrade to v1.10.0.1 your customers may lose access to their open tickets.</p>\n<p><span id=\"rma\" class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-x-large\">Deprecation of the Rate My App feature</span></p>\n<p>We'll be removing the Rate My App feature in a future update. In this update we've given your developers a heads up about that by adding a warning to the Support SDK. If you're using this feature, you'll get a build warning.</p>\n<p>If you are already using Rate My App, it will continue to work unless you upgrade\u00a0later to a version of the Support SDK that doesn't contain the feature or you disable it in your settings.</p>\n<p>Find out more about this deprecation <a href=\"https://help.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010314388\">here</a>.</p>",

Zendesk uses OneLogin as a service provider and a small subset of Zendesk customers also use OneLogin to access their Zendesk accounts. We have quickly assembled a cross-functional team and have been busy analyzing the impact. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Note: This is not a breach of Zendesk\u2019s software or services</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but because we believe secrets used to protect and configure applications between OneLogin and Zendesk were included in data lost during compromise of OneLogin\u2019s systems, immediate action may be required to secure your environment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From OneLogin\u2019s security incident notification:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"On Wednesday, May 31, 2017, we detected that there was unauthorized access to OneLogin data in our US data region. All customers served by our US data center are affected; customer data was compromised, including the ability to decrypt encrypted data. We have since blocked this unauthorized access, reported the matter to law enforcement, and are working with an independent security firm to assess how the unauthorized access happened and to verify the extent of the impact.\" - OneLogin</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OneLogin's full security advisory can be found here (OneLogin Authentication Required): </span><a href=\"https://support.onelogin.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002695483\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://support.onelogin.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002695483</span></a></p>\n<p><strong>What we\u2019ve done</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The security of your Zendesk data is of the utmost importance to us. Our team took immediate action overnight to rotate all OneLogin credentials globally across our organization and are further assessing the situation. </span></p>\n<p><strong>What you should do</strong></p>\n<p><em>If your organization uses OneLogin as a service provider</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it is strongly advised to perform the specific remediation steps they have recommended to impacted customers as outlined in the following article (OneLogin authentication required): <a href=\"https://support.onelogin.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002695483\">https://support.onelogin.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002695483</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Zendesk specific remediation items, OneLogin can be configured to access Zendesk in two different ways:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using SAML authentication</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By storing Zendesk passwords</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are using SAML authentication, you will need to </span><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663676-Using-SAML-for-single-sign-on-Professional-and-Enterprise-\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">generate a new SAML certificate and update the fingerprint in your Zendesk SAML settings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are using OneLogin to store Zendesk passwords, it is strongly suggested that you perform a Zendesk password reset for all users.

    "body": "<p>Late last year we introduced a feature that handles undeliverable email addresses. Initially it was doing (we thought) a really good job capturing email bounces and preventing further messages delivered to servers which can't process them. Eventually we started to see more and more concerns, and recently we made some changes to get better at capturing these messages, and everything went crazy.</p>\n<p>When we began processing error codes buried in attachments we saw our numbers shoot straight up, marking many times more users as undeliverable. This massive increase made it clear we weren't digging deep enough into the error messages to know whether the failure was related to content, permanent state of failure, or some temporary state.</p>\n<p>As of today (May 31st, 2017)\u00a0we will be turning off our delivery failure notification processing entirely. This change is already in effect for all accounts. Though there is a risk that this will increase our rate of sending email to bad addresses, we feel that the impact on customers has been great enough to take that risk. We are using this as an opportunity to dig deeper into our treatment of these notifications, and categorize them more carefully. Our previous attempts, even though we went to great lengths to study examples, were not sufficient, and we apologize for the difficulty. When we have a more thorough understanding, we'll bring these changes back.</p>\n<p>A few notes about these changes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We will stop capturing bounce notifications and using them to mark individual user identities undeliverable.</li>\n<li>Currently undeliverable users will remain so, but you can always mark them deliverable in the user profile.</li>\n<li>Email notifications of delivery failures will be captured to log the messages they receive, allowing us to use them in our research.</li>\n<li>Notifications will not create suspended tickets.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This change will be as temporary as possible, and we will keep you updated with our progress. Again, we're very sorry for any inconvenience we've caused, and we invite you to reach out to us with any questions.</p>",

    "body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are excited to introduce our brand new offering, Zendesk Guide, the evolution of our existing Help Center product.</span>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/guide\">Guide</a> is a smart </span><a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/help-center/knowledge-base-software/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">knowledge base</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that helps tap into your team's collective\u00a0knowledge and puts it to work. With Guide, customers get better self-service, and agents see improved efficiency and faster resolution times. And because it\u2019s the only knowledge base native to Zendesk, it works seamlessly with Zendesk Support.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guide is available for all Support plans. There are two Guide plans available for new Support customers after May 2, 2017. We will grandfather existing Support customers into a plan called Guide Legacy. The details about these plans are at the <a href=\"#plans\">bottom of the article</a>.</span></p>\n<p>Guide includes all the Help Center functionality, plus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Help Center becomes a feature of Guide</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Admin UI and navigation updates </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New knowledge authoring and management tools</span></li>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Article History</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automatic XML sitemap</span></li>\n</ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowledge Capture app and dashboard (early access program)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Answer Bot Compatibility (early access program)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Help Center is now a feature of Guide</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Help Center has become more than just a destination where your customers help themselves by viewing FAQ articles. With our Embeddables, Web Widget, and Mobile SDK, you\u00a0can serve contextual Help Center knowledge outside of your\u00a0Help Center, so your customers can help themselves as they browse your website or interact with your mobile app. Your content is not bound to your Help Center any longer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we\u2019ve redefined this feature set into our new product called Guide, we\u2019re rethinking about how we talk about Help Center within this larger context. From today forward, Help Center is a feature of the Guide product. Help Center is then defined as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A branded customer-facing support site</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A publishing location for your knowledge base content</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community, for customer collaboration (Guide Professional)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Requests portal, where customers create and manage tickets\u00a0(Guide Professional)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Admin UI and navigation updates</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside the new Guide brand, we are introducing improvements to the admin UI and navigation updates that will make accessing and navigating Guide more intuitive. These changes are outlined in detail <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003993047\">in this announcement</a>.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">New knowledge authoring and management tools</h2>\n<h3 class=\"title topictitle3\">History view</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more content managers you have, the harder it becomes to track changes. The History view empowers you to see every article change, giving you better insight into how your content evolves over time. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guide Managers will be able to filter actions by specific users, review specific changes, such as \u201cseeing all archived articles or all published articles,\u201d and also drill down into specific changes, such as attachments added or authors changed.</span>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004769747\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about the History view</span></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"title topictitle3\">Automatic XML sitemap</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our efforts to continuously improve how Help Center articles perform in search engines, we are introducing an XML Sitemap that helps search engines like Google find pages in your Help Center. This ensures that users can find articles, sections, categories and other public content when searching, but it does not improve individual ranking of these pages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The standard Help Center structure, with clearly marked breadcrumbs, already makes it easy for search engines to correctly index your pages, and with the sitemap, search engines will now have visibility into all your pages regardless of your Help Center structure. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>The sitemap is automatically enabled and is updated every two\u00a0hours with new content, ensuring that search engines have the latest content. The sitemap is accessible to search engine crawlers via the robots.txt file on your Help Center.</span></p>\n<p>Your xml sitemap can be viewed at: subdomain.zendesk.com/hc/sitemap.xml\u00a0</p>\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Knowledge Capture app (early access)</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important for agents to be knowledgeable, but it\u2019s the ability to effortlessly capture, organize, and share knowledge that matters most for agents to grow and improve knowledge over time. Gartner reports that organizations with a proper knowledge management discipline in place can </span><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/doc/2677716/knowledge-management-transform-crm-customer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduce overall support costs by 25%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Guide Knowledge Capture app enables your agents to search and link articles to tickets, provide quick inline feedback on articles to aid in content improvements, and create new articles while answering tickets, using a pre-defined template, directly in the Zendesk Support agent interface. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data about app activities is captured in a custom Insights dashboard that shows key metrics for ticket impact, agent performance and content performance upon installation of the app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowledge Capture enables a continuous feedback loop and creates a great resource of knowledge for agents\u2014both new and experienced\u2014that helps you deliver an improved self-service experience over time.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004339507\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the Knowledge Capture early access program.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\">Answer Bot\u00a0(early access)</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://www.zendesk.com/answer-bot\">Answer Bot</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, previously known as Automatic Answers,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is powered by our newest and most advanced artificial intelligence yet.

The plan for existing customers is called\u00a0Guide Legacy.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guide Legacy is available to existing Support customers only (a value of $15 per agent/month for new customers). It includes all existing Help Center features prior to the release of Guide, plus the advanced capabilities listed above (UI changes, History view, Knowledge Capture app, SEO XML Sitemap, and Answer Bot compatibility). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are on Guide Legacy, you will be able to enjoy the above feature set for as long as you are a customer, even if you add new agents or change Support plans.</span></p>",

When we released the five original themes for Help Center we included a feature that we call the Mobile Layout. This is an unbranded and adaptive mobile experience for these themes.

This uses a responsive layout to give customers a great experience on all devices, out of the box. It\u2019s also fully customizable, and any customizations you make to your theme are reflected on mobile devices as well. This is considered an industry best-practice and provides a better experience for users as well as improves things like SEO and accessibility.</span>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, when using the Copenhagen theme we still allowed you to turn on the Mobile layout in general settings. When using the Copenhagen theme, the Mobile layout will actually degrade a customer\u2019s experience.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responsive Copenhagen vs Mobile Layout</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115008789587/copenhagen_v_mobile_layout.png\" alt=\"copenhagen_v_mobile_layout.png\"><br><br></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s changing?</span></h3>\n<p><strong>If you have the Copenhagen theme and </strong><strong><em>haven\u2019t</em></strong><strong> enabled the Mobile layout,</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the setting to turn on the mobile layout will no longer appear in General settings.<br><br> </span></p>\n<p><strong>If you have the Copenhagen theme and </strong><strong><em>have</em></strong><strong> \u00a0enabled the Mobile layout</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you will see the the setting to disable the mobile layout.

    "body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one likes to wait on hold. But the good news is that callback from queue -- functionality that allows callers to opt out of waiting and request a callback when an agent becomes available, without losing their place in the queue -- ensures that your customers will wait on hold no longer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Callback from Queue you can:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Enhance your customer experience</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"http://customersthatstick.com/blog/customer-service-techniques/do-customers-prefer-a-call-back-this-study-says-yes/\">75% of customers prefer a callback option to waiting on hold.</a> When you give your callers an option to request a callback instead of waiting to speak with a live agent, you demonstrate that you value their time, a courtesy that boosts customers\u2019 impression of your service and brand and results in higher CSAT.</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduce abandoned calls</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>When facing long wait times, callers often give up and call back later, resulting in a high number of abandoned and repeat calls. Studies show that <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://fonolo.com/why-call-backs/\">callback from queue can reduce abandoned calls at least 32%</a>, so your customers can connect with live agents <em>without</em> increasing call volumes.</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Manage high volumes</strong>\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>With callback from queue, you and your team can smooth out spikes in call volume <em>without </em>hiring more agents, whether those call spikes are hourly, weekly or seasonal. \u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Boost employee morale</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Lastly, callback from queue can help improve the agent experiences. When callers haven\u2019t had to wait a long time to reach an agent, they are more likely to be calm and reasonable when speaking with your staff. That reduces stress on your agents and helps them resolve your customers\u2019 issues quickly and happily.</p>\n<h3>\u00a0</h3>\n<h3><strong>Using the feature</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Callback is configured for each individual number.

It's been a long, hard road to get it working right, but now we're ready to make\u00a0the feature publicly available to all accounts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Email generally contains two parts: A \"plain text\" part and an \"HTML\" part. Sometimes they contain more parts, and some are encoded, but for our purposes those two are all that matter. In the past we've always taken the plain text version (which has no formatting) and turned it into a comment.\u00a0With the new changes we'll be reading the HTML part, processing it to make sure we're pulling in the formatting we want, and presenting it in a consumable way in the ticket.</p>\n<p>As of today, you'll be able to make the switch and start seeing full color, bold, and italic text in your incoming Support tickets.\u00a0You'll also get inline images, tables, and fancy formatting. Everything you see in your inbox, you'll see in tickets, making the conversation with your customers totally faithful to their intent.</p>\n<p><strong>Never miss important context. </strong>If a customer underlines a word in an email or uses color to distinguish text, when everything is plain text you lose this specificity. The same is true for inline images, tables, and other formatting. Customers use these elements\u00a0to communicate, and modern communication happens in rich text. Now you won't lose\u00a0the context.</p>\n<p><strong>Better Productivity.</strong> Now your agents don't have to open up a new window to verify the HTML version or go hunting for an image that was turned into an attachment. These are small things, but they add up over time.</p>\n<h3>Set up</h3>\n<p>To start seeing rich content in your tickets, just turn on the setting. You'll find it in your Admin area, under Channels\u00a0&gt; Email. It looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115016823747/blobid0.png\" width=\"780\" height=\"88\"></p>\n<p>Enabling this setting\u00a0means that every email you receive will be processed as an HTML email. It won't affect previous messages, and turning it off won't undo the processing on any email processed while it was enabled.</p>\n<h3>Email formatting</h3>\n<p>Nearly every kind of formatting you can put in an email will be transferred into tickets now. Comments will contain a faithful rendering of any email sent to your Zendesk. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic text formatting (bold, italic, underline)</li>\n<li>Images</li>\n<li>Colors (text, background, etc)</li>\n<li>Table layouts (borders, padding, arrangements, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are only a couple things aren't\u00a0supported:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Special fonts (all text will be rendered in Zendesk's usual font for tickets)</li>\n<li>Background images</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's a very complicated looking example email:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115007881488/dscemail.jpg\" alt=\"dscemail.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"468\"></p>\n<h3>\u00a0</h3>\n<h3>Security</h3>\n<p>We took security very seriously during the process of building this feature. External links and embedded HTML in email can be exploited in a number of ways. We're taking care to avoid everything we can, and run checks against the message to prevent any malicious code from being run in Zendesk. We also verify that all images are safe before rendering them in your account.\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Rendering</h3>\n<p>Processing HTML within the already complex space of rendering rich content in tickets has created a lot of bugs. Rendering will never be 100% perfect, but at this point we are confident that it is very close to perfect, and creating a visual that is as expected well over 99% of the time. That said, there are a few things we have seen and could see again:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Missing content, including partial or full email text</li>\n<li>Problems with our Agent Forwarding or Mail API features working correctly</li>\n<li>Issues with line spacing or padding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you see issues like this, please report them to our Support team so we can investigate as soon as possible. This shouldn't be cause for alarm, though. We process millions of emails a day, and have still only had a handful of these problems (and none recently).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

E.164 numbers can have a maximum of fifteen digits and are usually written as follows: [+][country code][subscriber number including area code]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trying to save numbers that don't conform to this format will display an error and will fail to save to the user profile. For example: a US phone number like \u2018415 555 2671\u2019 will need to be added as \u2018+14155552671\u2019. </span>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>If Validate user phone numbers is turned off</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When phone number validation is turned off we don\u2019t enforce the E.164 standards but some logic is still applied to a phone number, even when setting it as a direct line ,to try and format it as a valid phone number. This valid format was often achieved by adding a +1 to the start of the number, and by removing spaces and characters. This would often correctly format the number and proved useful to customers adding US phone numbers as the +1 was added automatically without having phone number validation turned on. However it has also proved very difficult for customers trying to add anything but US phone numbers. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>What\u2019s changing?</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Beginning the week of March 6th</strong> we will make the following changes:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When \u201cValidate user phone numbers\u201d is turned off, no formatting will be applied to the number added in the Phone field for a user even when setting that number as a direct line.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that \u2018+1\u2019 or \u2018+\u2019 will no longer be added.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Special characters such as (), or additional spaces in the number, will not be removed.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will take the phone number as provided by you and add it to the user profile. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For better structure and to have numbers that are always actionable we recommend that phone number validation is turned on for your account.

    "body": "<div style=\"padding: 5px 8px; background-color: #78a300; border: 1px solid #b62929; border-radius: 6px; margin: 0 0 15px 0;\">This feature has been\u00a0released to all accounts as of March 1st, 2017</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Zendesk Support, new tickets have always begun with a public message --- one that customers can see. We\u2019ve always looked at a ticket as the start of a conversation. Over time, though, many of you have made the request that you\u2019d like to begin a ticket with a private comment; to keep the ticket internal, while still associating it to a person in the requester field.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Beginning the week of February 20th</em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we\u2019ll allow you to create a new ticket with either a public or private comment. Tickets with no public comments will be called </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">private tickets</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and will stay internal, hidden from customers. </span></p>\n<h2>Some things are different about private tickets</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, private tickets are just tickets. Since private comments have always been kept hidden from end users, a whole ticket full of nothing but private comments is pretty self explanatory. That said, we\u2019ve made a few small changes:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They don\u2019t show up in a user\u2019s \u201cMy Activities\u201d list or in Help Center search</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comments added to a private ticket default to private unless the agent overrides this</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We show warnings to agents when switching to public, just in case</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Many things are just the same</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They\u2019re still tickets, though, almost everything you\u2019ve come to expect from tickets is still true. You can still build business rules (triggers, automations, and SLAs) and trust that these will affect your private tickets. You can also add a condition to any rule to exclude them. Private tickets can be assigned, and go through all the normal status changes. Because you can switch to public any time, these are just silent tickets, being worked on like any other, or waiting to begin that conversation.</span>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Creating and using private tickets</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a private ticket is a breeze. We\u2019ve added the same selector for public versus private tickets to the new ticket page that you see every time you update a ticket. This is true in our mobile apps as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your account was created before April 8, 2017, you\u2019ll need to enable your agents to create private tickets. The new setting will be found on the Tickets menu, under setting in your Zendesk Support admin menu.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115014695448/blobid0.png\"></p>\n<p>If your account was created after April 8, this setting doesn't appear. Agents can create private tickets by default.\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115005685027/0a0296a6-9637-43e9-bfea-14784e5aecde.png\" alt=\"0a0296a6-9637-43e9-bfea-14784e5aecde.png\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To provide a little bit more certainty that internal tickets aren\u2019t accidentally made public, new comments default to private when you update the ticket. We\u2019ve also added this warning, which agents will see when they start to add a public comment. You can opt out of this warning at any time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115005736448/ec2ac831-8fd3-47d6-8244-f52e4ad2590a.png\" alt=\"ec2ac831-8fd3-47d6-8244-f52e4ad2590a.png\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you create a public comment, the ticket starts to be visible to the requester. Email notifications will go out as usual. Remember that the subject you choose becomes visible, so don\u2019t put any sensitive information into the subject line!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115005685147/2ad54965-3b92-4286-bfb9-15df873a597c.png\" alt=\"2ad54965-3b92-4286-bfb9-15df873a597c.png\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some triggers and automations send email. While private comments are never sent out in email notifications, some of these rules may still cause an email to be sent as part of a private ticket. You may want to take some time to prepare your business rules before starting to use this feature. We\u2019re created a guide for this process, which will be available soon.</span></p>\n<p>For more information about enabling and creating private tickets, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203690946-Creating-a-ticket-on-behalf-of-the-requester#topic_uyq_5rx_yy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creating a private ticket for an end-user</a>.</p>\n<h2>Things to do with private tickets</h2>\n<p>There are many uses for a ticket that's completely internal. For a few ideas, here are some things to try:\u00a0</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make records of calls and meetings with your customers. These can be stored as tickets, meaning you get a more accurate picture of your Support team's effort, without bothering your customer.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take action\u00a0on issues that you can't share. Sometimes tasks need to be\u00a0carried out on behalf of a customer account\u00a0-- investigations or corrective actions -- that might be sensitive. With a Private Ticket,\u00a0this can remain internal.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepare for an interaction before communications open up. Because Private tickets can be\u00a0shared just by adding a public comment, you can use the ticket to gather materials, prepare, or take notes. Until you add a public comment, the ticket helps you get ready. When it goes public, it's just like any other ticket.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Send someone else a task. Throw together a private ticket, record\u00a0some steps or actions that need to be taken (maybe use a macro if you're going to do this a lot?), and assign it to someone else, or set\u00a0it in a queue for the next available person.\u00a0</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these things have two things in common. You get to associate it to a customer, meaning the record is there for future reference, and you get the value of reporting, whether that's accurate accounting of what your team is doing, or the amount of work you're doing on behalf of a particular customer or organization.\u00a0</span>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>\u00a0</h2>",

You create comments within macros just like you used to - only now you have a full editor to format your content with.</p>\n<p>Before you get started with rich content in macros, you'll want to make sure you actually <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203661586-Enabling-formatting-options-for-agents\" target=\"_blank\">have rich content turned on for your account</a>.</p>\n<p>You're probably not going to be making use of too many cats in your macros, but this is the internet and I needed a simple example. Below is an example of very simple formatting, followed by an inline image of a beautiful British blue cat, and an image of a rare burrito-cat attached to that\u00a0comment. The attachment doesn't have to be an image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115003688467/bold-italic-cat.png\" alt=\"bold-italic-cat.png\"></p>\n<p>When this macro is used on a ticket, the text gets added to the ticket just like it would normally, followed by any attachments on the macro.</p>\n<p>We have lots more detail in <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001236988\" target=\"_blank\">Creating macros for tickets</a>.</p>\n<h2>Updating existing macros to use rich content</h2>\n<p>We wanted to make sure we reduced disruption to your existing workflow. This means your existing macros do not automatically become rich content. We have provided a way to easily convert content if you need to.</p>\n<p>When looking at an existing macro with a comment action already saved, you will note a link at the bottom right of the content box called \"Use rich content\"</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115007448468/use_rich_content.png\" alt=\"use_rich_content.png\"></p>\n<p>Clicking this will copy your existing comment action, load in the rich content editor, and place your comment back into the editor. It's like copying and pasting your existing comment without all the hassle. Once clicked, you're free to format your comment, and inline images or attach files.</p>\n<div class=\"note note\">\n<strong>If you're a heavy user of our mobile app, Zendesk SMS, Facebook or Twitter integration, or any of our channel apps, </strong>we encourage you to make sure to <a href=\"#plain-text-comments\">check out the bottom of this announcement</a> for info about an extra step you may want to take -- setting up a plain text version of your macro.</div>\n<h2>Are attachments or inline images\u00a0available for any other formatting option?</h2>\n<p>You may be using no formatting options today, or perhaps you're using Markdown. If this is the case, you will be unable to use any functionality mentioned in this announcement.</p>\n<h2>I don't see the formatting options when creating a new macro!</h2>\n<p>You probably don't have rich content turned on yet. It's a simple setting changes, check out <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203661586-Enabling-formatting-options-for-agents\" target=\"_blank\">Enabling formatting options for agents</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"plain-text-comments\">A note for heavy users of our mobile app, Zendesk SMS, Facebook or Twitter integrations, or any of our channel apps</h2>\n<p>Currently and in most cases, rich content within macros won't play well with our mobile app, Facebook or Twitter or our channel apps. This is largely due to a lack of support for formatted content on those environments.</p>\n<p>That's why we added an extra optional step. You can now\u00a0create a \"plain text\" alternative when composing a rich content comment in a macro. This way you can use rich content where supported, and the plain text alternative anywhere else. The right one will be applied\u00a0automatically.</p>\n<p>When looking at an existing rich content macro, you will note a link at the bottom right of the content box called \"Add plain text\"</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115006878468/add_plain_text.png\" alt=\"add_plain_text.png\"></p>\n<p>Clicking this will\u00a0show you a second content box. You can put your alternate version of the macro in here. We'll pre-populate it with text from the rich content version to get you started, but you may\u00a0want to revise\u00a0it so that it makes sense without the rich content.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/115006793827/plain_text_input.png\" alt=\"plain_text_input.png\"></p>\n<p>You can remove the plain text version by clicking \"Remove plain text\" in the lower right.

Some issues with our email security apparatus were exposed during rollout, causing email to be suspended needlessly. We're investigating the best way to improve this before rolling this change out again.</div>\n<p>Today we announce two small changes to our email processing which will improve our Email channel's security. Zendesk Support currently has checks in place to stop spam, and block malware and other delinquent emails. This change handles some cases which should reduce the likelihood of spam or malicious emails from making their way into your tickets.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Suspending messages with uncertain authentication</strong></p>\n<p>Zendesk will now automatically suspend any email which fails a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail\">DKIM check</a>. These messages are frequently suspended now because of our spam checking tools, but this change will make that automatic. We won't automatically suspend if the header is missing, only if it actually fails a check. This standard is widely supported, failures are rare, but they're a great indication of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing\">spoofing</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing\">phishing</a> attempts. The suspension type for this will be spam.</p>\n<p>If you haven't already, you can keep up to date with your suspended tickets by <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663246-Managing-suspended-tickets-and-spam#topic_ijw_qqk_ae\">subscribing</a> to a suspended tickets notification.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Blocking spoofed Zendesk messages</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to the above, we'll be using\u00a0an extra sense\u00a0of caution when we see email which appears to be from Zendesk. Because we have already set up a <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/219401127-Zendesk-and-DMARC\">DMARC reject policy</a>, we will now be blocking any email which claims a sending address in the Zendesk domain. If it fails a DKIM check, we will reject it. Malicious actors could always pose as Zendesk to attempt to get sensitive information, so we've elected to block them completely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As we continue to grow we will continue to make changes to protect your email channel. This is not the last stop on this destination.</p>",

We did not mention this ahead of time out of concern it would be exploited, but we are explaining it now for transparency's sake.</em></p>\n<p><em><em class=\"gmail_msg\">Because subject matching only<span class=\"m_3491115255108616381inbox-inbox-Apple-converted-space gmail_msg\">\u00a0</span>happened\u00a0when the sender of an email was also the requester of an existing ticket with the same subject, this was<span class=\"m_3491115255108616381inbox-inbox-Apple-converted-space gmail_msg\">\u00a0</span>very rare.</em> However, Zendesk Support adds CCs to a ticket when they're included in an email, making it possible to merge unrelated email threads. If one of your customers or partners sends you an email and CCs another party, a ticket is created. They might later send a new email, CC different party, and use the same subject. We\u00a0would have then updated the same ticket, and notified the first CC of the new message, which they were never meant to see.</em></p>\n<p><em>With this update, we have eliminated this possibility.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>It should come as no surprise that Zendesk processes a lot of email. We receive millions of messages a day and make a number of decisions about each; whether to reject, suspend, create a new ticket, or associate a message with an existing ticket. The last decision has a lot of moving parts.</p>\n<p>We primarily rely on message IDs (which should always be unique), our own \"encoded IDs\" (which we know are unique), and in certain circumstances the regular numerical IDs of tickets. We've also, for some time now, occasionally matched an incoming email with an existing ticket because of a matching subject line.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>Beginning November 21st, 2016</em></strong>, Zendesk will no longer match incoming email with existing tickets by means of subject.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Why this change?</span></p>\n<p>As we've grown, we've seen more false positive matches. Mailing lists and automated emails re-use subject lines. While, contact between the inboxes people use is safe, the amount of automated email in the world has made this feature more trouble than it's worth. We'll continue to rely on reliable, unique identifiers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Subject matching in Zendesk is already very uncommon. We've made it our lowest priority matching criteria, and have limited it so that it only associates two tickets when there is an exact match, and when the person sending the email is the same as the requester of the existing ticket. For this reason, there are\u00a0a very low number of subject matches each day in each account.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">What will the effects be?</span></p>\n<p>You will\u00a0see\u00a0some messages\u00a0create a new ticket when they\u00a0would have previously created a comment on an existing ticket. In most cases the messages were not directly related in the first place. In some rare occasions we receive a malformed email that lacks identifiers. This may cause\u00a0a message not to be threaded. After extensive research, we are confident this will be uncommon. The reduction in false positives and unintended associations (which have caused many concerns from Zendesk users) far outweighs this, in our opinion.</p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">What if we don't want this change?</span></p>\n<p>If for any reason this change seems wrong to you, or if you are currently relying on Subject Matching for any reason, let us know by adding\u00a0a comment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",
